#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Print a rendered lecture to PDF beside its HTML, using headless Chrome.
#
# Chrome rather than weasyprint or wkhtmltopdf, because a lecture typesets its
# mathematics in JavaScript. KaTeX is vendored and inlined rather than pulled
# from a CDN, so there is no network dependency, but it still runs in the page.
# A print engine with no script runtime emits the raw \frac{}{} instead, which
# looks like a successful conversion until somebody reads page four.
#
# Page size, margins and the print-colour treatment live in the @page and
# @media print blocks of assets/lecture.css, rather than in the flags below, so
# that Cmd-P from the browser produces the same page this script does.
#
# `--virtual-time-budget` waits for KaTeX, which is now inlined and typesets
# synchronously at load, so the budget no longer covers a network fetch and
# 5 seconds is generous. Each run still gets its own throwaway profile
# directory: concurrent Chrome instances sharing one profile fight over its
# lock and one of them silently produces nothing.
#
# Chrome 152 writes the PDF and then declines to exit, so the loop below is a
# watchdog rather than a plain call: it waits for the file to appear and stop
# growing, then terminates the browser itself. macOS ships no timeout(1), which
# rules out the one-line version of this.
#
# Paths are required, matching render_lecture.sh. A no-argument default that
# swept the whole of lectures/ would be a long job started by accident.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/html_to_pdf.sh lectures/S1_credit-survival-bridge.html
#   bash scripts/html_to_pdf.sh lectures/*.html
