# Render a Quarto lecture and strip Quarto's theme assets from the output.
#
# assets/lecture.css was written for the course authors' pages, which carry
# full Quarto markup (#quarto-content, #quarto-margin-sidebar, main.content)
# while their _files/libs/ assets were never downloaded, so Bootstrap and
# quarto.js are effectively absent. This script reproduces that structure for
# our own lectures: render with the default theme so the markup matches, then
# remove every <link> and <script> that points into _files/libs/ and delete
# the libs directory. KaTeX loads from `vendor/katex/` and is inlined
# afterwards by `scripts/inline_assets.py`, so the output carries no network
# dependency.
#
# `theme: none` is not an alternative: it drops the wrapper markup itself, so
# the stylesheet's two-column rail never engages.
#
# The script then moves the figures out of Quarto's own output directory. Quarto
# writes them to `<stem>_files/figure-html/`, which gave credit_lectures/ one
# directory per lecture and sixteen of them in a listing, so they are collapsed
# into `<dir>/figures/<stem>/` and the `src` paths in the HTML are rewritten to
# match. Quarto recreates `<stem>_files` on every render, so this step is what
# keeps the layout from reverting; it also clears the empty `_files` directory
# that a figure-free lecture leaves behind once its libs/ has gone. Note that
# `lectures/figures/` is NOT gitignored here: the exemplar executes Python and
# emits three PNGs, all three are tracked, and CI copies the directory into the
# published site because it cannot re-render them. A lecture's figures are
# therefore committed artefacts and a re-render that changes them shows up in
# `git status`.
#
# One directory goes through here, `lectures/`. Paths are required rather than
# defaulted, because the lectures execute Python against the gitignored credit
# parquets, so a sweep on a fresh clone would fail partway through on missing
# data rather than on the lecture asked for.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/render_lecture.sh lectures/S1_credit-survival-bridge.qmd
#   bash scripts/render_lecture.sh lectures/*.qmd
